# ERT Coding Challenge

## Instructions

Please submit all work products, including documentation, through your open public github account and discuss these during the technical interview process. Please complete as many assessment challenges as you would like. No hard timeline, so submit when you feel ready and have a good high-level understanding of what we do.  These exercises are extracted from our working code and are intended to provide realistic examples of what we do to support AFRL R&D ionospheric impact application development. Evaluation criteria are based on thoroughness, attention to detail, problem-solving, and communication in writing and verbal.
